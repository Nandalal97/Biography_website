               About A. P. J. Abdul Kalam
            </h2>


            <p>&#9755;A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, in full <b> Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</b>, was born on October 15, 1931, in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, India. <br/><br/>
                &#9755;He served as the <b>11th President of India</b>  from 2002 to 2007. <br/><br/>

                &#9755; Kalam earned a degree in aeronautical engineering from the Madras Institute of Technology and in 1958 joined the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). <br/><br/>

                &#9755; In 1969, he moved to the Indian Space Research Organisation, where he was project director of the <b> <b>SLV-III</b>,</b> the first satellite launch vehicle that was both designed and produced in India. <br/><br/>

                &#9755;Rejoining DRDO in 1982, Kalam planned the program that produced a number of successful missiles, which helped earn him the nickname <b> “Missile Man.” </b> <br
                >
                &#9755; Among those successes was Agni, India’s first intermediate-range ballistic missile, which incorporated aspects of the <b>SLV-III</b> and was launched in 1989. <br/><br/>

                &#9755; Among those successes was <b>Agni</b> , India’s first intermediate-range ballistic missile, which incorporated aspects of the <b>SLV-III</b> and was launched in 1989. <br/><br/>

                &#9755; He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974. <br/><br/>

                &#9755; From 1992 to 1997 Kalam was scientific adviser to the defense minister, and he later served as principal scientific adviser (1999–2001) to the government with the rank of cabinet minister. <br/><br/>

                &#9755; His prominent role in the country’s 1998 nuclear weapons tests solidified India as a nuclear power and established Kalam as a national hero, although the tests caused great concern in the international community. <br/><br/>


                &#9755; In 1998 Kalam put forward a countrywide plan called Technology Vision 2020, which he described as a road map for transforming India from a less-developed to a developed society in 20 years. The plan called for, among other measures, increasing agricultural productivity, emphasizing technology as a vehicle for economic growth, and widening access to health care and education. <br/><br/>

                &#9755; Kalam received 7 honorary doctorates from <b>40 universities</b> . The Government of India honoured him with the <b> Padma Bhushan in 1981</b> and the <b> Padma Vibhushan in 1990</b> for his work with ISRO and DRDO and his role as a scientific advisor to the Government. <br/><br/>

                &#9755; In 1997, Kalam received <b>India's highest civilian honour</b> , the <b>Bharat Ratna</b> , for his contribution to the scientific research and modernisation of defence technology in India. <br/><br/>

                &#9755; In 2013, he was the recipient of the <b>Von Braun Award from the National Space Society</b>  "to recognize excellence in the management and leadership of a space-related project". <br/><br/>

                &#9755; While delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and died from an apparent cardiac arrest on 27 July 2015, aged 83. <br/><br/>

                &#9755; Wheeler Island, a national missile test site in Odisha, was renamed Kalam Island in September 2015. <br/><br/>

                &#9755; A prominent road in New Delhi was renamed from Aurangzeb Road to <b>Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Road</b>  in August 2015. <br/><br/>

                &#9755; In February 2018, scientists from the Botanical Survey of India named a newly found plant species as Drypetes kalamii, in his honour. <br/><br/>
